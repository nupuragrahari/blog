Heya!

I am a software engineer by profession who mostly works with Javascript. I'm a learner by heart and honestly believe that nothing is impossible if you keep at it and stay determined.
The few lessons that i have learned so far are:
 - Don't let others put you down.
 - Keep learning
 - You can always do better
 - Do not quit,just don't !

It's been more than a year now since I started working with the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJs and NodeJs) stack.
I also have an affinity for literature and some of the authors I absolutely adore include Khaled Hosseini and Paulo Coelho.
