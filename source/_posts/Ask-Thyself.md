When things don’t seem to work out,
When the problem sees no logic,
When it is hovering upon you and seems all tragic,
When you feel you are about to crumble under all that load,
Do yourself a favour my dear,
And ask thyself !
For their is no mind that could know you more,
Their is no heart that understands you to the core,
Enlighten yourself with the knowledge you’ve always had,
Believe in the power and you will be glad,
You are your answer,
You’ve always been,
Now, when you need a favour,
Take a deep breath darling,
And ask thyself !
