She woke up early that day and with eyes half opened she got up to grab herself some coffee.That was something that started her day, no matter what would follow. She didn’t have plans, she hadn’t had any since the last week. All that hiding in just because she failed a test? Not the right choice many would say. So what if it was months of hard work that came down crashing the moment she read that mail with the subject line reading “Notice of rejection”. She should have acted brave and faked a smile. Well, she’ll soon have to. She can’t just stay there, lost in the city of the past. Yes, mending what has been broken might be different to her from what it is to you. But she was never the faking type, that was just not her thing. She will be strong again. She will smile again. She will do all of that, and that smile would be more real, more confident than it was ever before. Give her some time. Give all those broken hearts some time. They will rise eventually, stronger and smarter. All that you can do is to let them know you still believe in them. Please. Do believe in them!
